Doubts

(1) use of SET NOCOUNT ON/OFF; in sql
 -- Its display the "Command(s) completed successfully"
  Eg:  SET NOCOUNT on
       select * from PatientReg


(2) diff NVARCHAR(400) and VARCHAR

(3)lock
(4)param
(5)Checked
(6)Enum
(5)Encapsulation
(6)Stream
(7)stringbuilder
(8)string Vs String


Key Words

int? i = null;    Use This method only int accept null values
bool? ko = null;



Type costing Eg:

 int s = 9;
 double j = (double)s;

String
_______
  (1)String is an Class(System.string)
  (2)String is an Reference type(class)
  (3)A String object is called immutable (read-only) because its value cannot be modified once it has been created

string
________

  (1)string is an alise name of String class that is created by microsoft
  (2)string is an value type(data type).
  (3)string is a c# keyword.
  (4)string is a compile shortcut for System.String class.


(9)convert.tostring("XX") Vs .Tostrings

Tostrings
__________
Returns a null reference exception for str. (Not Accept Null values)
eg:
string str;
object i = null;
str = i.ToString();

convert.tostring(xxx)
______________________
Returns an empty string for str and does not throw an exception. If you dont
eg:
string str;
object i = null;
str = Convert.ToString(i);

difference between abstraction and encapsulation in c# with example
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Encapsulation: hiding data using getters and setters etc.

Abstraction: hiding implementation using abstract classes and interfaces etc.




(10)diff abstract vs interface
http://www.aspdotnet-suresh.com/2010/04/abstract-versus-interface.html
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AN ABSTRACT CLASS AND AN INTERFACE:

(1)An Abstract class doesn't provide full abstraction but an interface does provide full abstraction; i.e. both a declaration and a definition is given in an abstract class but not so in an interface.
(2)Using Abstract we can not achieve multiple inheritance but using an Interface we can achieve multiple inheritance.
(3)We can not declare a member field in an Interface.
(4)We can not use any access modifier i.e. public , private , protected , internal etc. because within an interface by default everything is public.
(5)An Interface member cannot be defined using the keyword static, virtual, abstract or sealed.
(6)an interface cannot declar variable(eg: var a=10),but abstract class can declar variable(eg: var a=10)
(7)an interface cannot declar constructor,an abstract class can declar constructor

(11)substring
  use for separate the String

concat 
  use for joining the String

(12)param


1)hashtable,array list,list,generick list
2)sql have clause
3)mvc architecture
4)diff view bag,view data,temp data

How to Improve Software Perfomance ??

*Bundling and minification
*Linq
.Use interface(reduce the count of Method)
   .use anonymous method (reduce the method content)
   .use delegate
   .Use LINQ

1)dot net server name=IIS.

Internet Information server
use:If click the debugger to run the page in browser.We use version iis 7.0

* Java server name=apache tom cat.

(1.1)OOps.........
Encapsulation: hiding data using getters and setters etc.
Abstraction: hiding implementation using abstract classes and interfaces etc.

2)what is unsafe code?
 within the function we use pointer variables means it is knows as un safe code.

eg: its one Type of Keyword we are using pointer variable means must use unsase code  
         
         int var = 20;    //Ordinery
         int* p = &var;   //Pointer
 


3) differ webservice and Wcf
4) data Anotation?
cilent and server side validation .
it is namespace
5)attributes?

6)linked list?
linked list is allocated memory at run time, so, there is no waste of memory. Performance wise linked list is slower than array because there is no direct access to linked list elements

7)scope identity
  * used in sql,
  * it take table primary key last vaue in 
   
8)difference between primary key and unique key

9) DLL

DLL stands for Dynamic Link Library: is a container of Classes each Class is a container of Methods. Method that represent Block of Code that contains our Business Logic that the DLL Structure. Why we need to build it? To collect all of our code to one place that makes the accessing to our code easier. to reference to dll file after create it. follow these links to know more. hope get help.

uses:

   The use of DLLs helps promote modularization of code, code reuse, efficient memory usage, and reduced disk space. Also when dll is used the programs will load faster and also run faster than normal codes. 

-->first service referance -> add referance

--> mvc4 ->add service reference


10)Query String
http://www.dotnetperls.com/querystring

eg)

 String Fromdate = Convert.ToString(Request.QueryString["Fromdate"]);
            String Todate = Convert.ToString(Request.QueryString["Todate"]);
            String Orgname = Convert.ToString(Request.QueryString["Orgname"]);


if we pass the parameter from view page to controller page that time get the value uaing parameter

eg: parameter:Fromdate

11)autocommit and rollback use in sql
 .Use for if delete the sql query means to retreive the query using rollback

eg ctrl + z  (Undo)
     ctrl + Y  (Redo)
COMMIT : 
     COMMIT command to make changes permanent save to a database during the current transaction.
ROLLBACK : 
    ROLLBACK command execute at the end of current transaction and undo/undone any changes made since the begin transaction.
SAVEPOINT : 
   SAVEPOINT command save the current point with the unique name in the processing of a transaction.


12)constructor

Class name is same but parameter is different

13) How to increase the application fast

.Use interface(reduce the count of Method)
.use anonymous method (reduce the method content)
.use delegate
.Use LINQ

14)IIS

Internet Information server
use:If click the debugger to run the page in browser.We use version iis 7.0

15) value type and reference type

value data type and reference data type
1) value( contain the data directly ) but reference ( refers to the data )
2) in value( every variable has its own copy) but  in reference (more than variable can refer to some objects)
3) in value (operation variable can`t effect on other variable ) but in reference (variable can affect other )
4) value types are(int, bool, float) but reference type are (array , class objects , string )

16)What is Stack and Keep

17)Boxing unBoxing

http://www.etechpulse.com/2013/04/difference-between-boxing-and-unboxing.html

18)session type?

asp.net supports 4 types of sessions 1)in process 2)state server 3)sql server 4)custom

19)wildcard in sql

20)view in sql

21)Features of Abstract Class

An abstract class cannot be instantiated.
An abstract class contain abstract members as well as non-abstract members.
An abstract class cannot be a sealed class because the sealed modifier prevents a class from being inherited and the abstract modifier requires a class to be inherited.
A non-abstract class which is derived from an abstract class must include actual implementations of all the abstract members of parent abstract class.
An abstract class can be inherited from a class and one or more interfaces.
An Abstract class can has access modifiers like private, protected, internal with class members. But abstract members cannot have private access modifier.
An Abstract class can has instance variables (like constants and fields).
An abstract class can has constructors and destructor.
An abstract method is implicitly a virtual method.
Abstract properties behave like abstract methods.
An abstract class cannot be inherited by structures.
An abstract class cannot support multiple inheritance.

(23)diff between trungate and delete in sql
http://www.geekinterview.com/question_details/24530
http://sql-oracle-mysql.blogspot.in/2010/11/difference-between-drop-truncate-and.html

DELETE
1. DELETE is a DML Command.
2. DELETE statement is executed using a row lock, each row in the table is locked for deletion.
3. We can specify filters in where clause
4. It deletes specified data if where condition exists.
5. Delete activates a trigger because the operation are logged individually.
6. Slower than truncate because, it keeps logs.
7. Rollback is possible.

TRUNCATE
1. TRUNCATE is a DDL command.
2. TRUNCATE TABLE always locks the table and page but not each row.
3. Cannot use Where Condition.
4. It Removes all the data.
5. TRUNCATE TABLE cannot activate a trigger because the operation does not log individual row deletions.
6. Faster in performance wise, because it doesn't keep any logs.
7. Rollback is not possible.

(26)Difference between Stored Procedure and Function in Sql with Example
http://tutoriz.com/Thread-Difference-between-Stored-Procedure-and-Function-in-Sql-with-Example

1. Procedure can have both input\output parameters
But function can have only input parameter.
2. Inside procedure we can use DML (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) statements.
But Inside function we can’t use DML statements.
3. We can’t utilize stored procedure in Select Statement,
But we can use function in Select Statement.
4. We can use Try-Catch Block in Stored Procedure,
But Inside function we can’t use Try-Catch block.
5. Procedure can return 0 or n values (max 1024),
But function can return only 1 value which is mandatory.
6. Procedure can’t be call from function,
But we can call function from Procedure.
7. We can go for transaction management in procedure,
But we can't go in function.
8. Stored Procedures cannot be used in the SQL statements anywhere in the WHERE/HAVING/SELECT section 
But we can use Function anywhere.
9.We can’t join Stored Procedure,
But We can join functions.

(31)SQL GRANT Command and SQL REVOKE Command:

SQL GRANT is a command used to provide access or privileges on the database objects to the users.(user access rights--permission)

The REVOKE command removes user access rights or privileges to the database objects.

(32)SQL Views

CREATE VIEW view_name

(33)Hashtable vs Dictionary differences:

http://www.aspdotnet-suresh.com/2013/09/difference-bw-array-and-arraylist-in-csharp-example.html
(34)Arrays vs ArrayLists

Arrays :
Array is of fixed size 
These are strong type collection and allow to store fixed length
In arrays we can store only one datatype either int, string, char etc…
Arrays belong to System.Array namespace
Array is a reference type data type 

ArrayLists:
ArrayList is allowed to grow as needed 
Array Lists are not strong type collection and size will increase or decrease dynamically
In arraylist we can store all the datatype values
Arraylist belongs to System.Collection namespaces
Array list is a class . 

(35)
Arraylist:
It is like Array of objects.
"System.Collections" is the Namespace for Arraylist. It automatically added to namespace section in aspx.cs page.
We need not to specify object type arraylist going to contain.
In arraylist each item is stored as object. And return value as object.
It needs to box and unbox the elements.

List<T>:
"System.Collections.Generic" is the Namespace for List. We need to add this.
We need to specify object type which type of elements it contain. 
Ex: List<string> StrObj=new List<string>();
From the above example StrObj will only store string objects.
It doesn't need.


(36)diff nvarchar Vs  varchar

varchar                                         nvarchar  
________
*NOn-Unicode characters.                          *Unicode characters. 
Can store maximum 8000 Non-Unicode characters.   *Can store maximum 4000 
*supprt all language                             *not supported
*It takes 1 byte per character                   *It takes 2 byte per character
*FirstName Length=1                              *FirstName Length=1


(36)diff nchar Vs  nvarchar  
1. nchar and nvarchar can store Unicode characters. 
2. char and varchar cannot store Unicode characters. 
3. char and nchar are fixed-length which will reserve storage space for number of characters you specify even if you don't use up all that space. 
4. varchar and nvarchar are variable-length which will only use up spaces for the characters you store. It will not reserve storage like char or nchar. 

1. char : fixed-length character data with a maximum length of 8000 characters. 
2. nchar: fixed-length unicode data with a maximum length of 4000 characters. 
3. Char = 8 bit length 
4. NChar = 16 bit length

http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/816448/Virtual-vs-Override-vs-New-Keyword-in-Csharp


Static Polymorphism:
____________________
In static polymorphism, the decision and response to a method is determined at the compile time. Therefore, it is also known as compile-time polymorphism.

Dynamic Polymorphism:
_____________________
In dynamic polymorphism, the decision and response to a method is determined at the run time. Therefore, it is also known as run-time polymorphism. 


Overloading                                                                                            Overriding
___________                                                                                             __________
      
Having same method name with different Signatures (parameters).                               1) Methods name and signatures must be same.
Overloading is the concept of compile time polymorphism.                                       2)Overriding is the concept of run time polymorphism.
Two functions having same name and return type, but with different type and/or number of arguments is called as Overloading.        3)When a function of base class is re-defined in the derived class called as Overriding.
 
It doesn't need inheritance.                                     4)It needs inheritance.
Method can be different access modifiers.                        5)Method should be public.

There are 11 different response types which can be sent to the end user :-
ViewResult - Renders a specified view to the response stream
PartialViewResult - Renders a specified partial view to the response stream
EmptyResult - An empty response is returned
RedirectResult - Performs an HTTP redirection to a specified URL
RedirectToRouteResult - Performs an HTTP redirection to a URL that is determined by the routing engine, based on given route data
JsonResult - Serializes a given object to JSON format
JavaScriptResult - Returns a piece of JavaScript code that can be executed on the client
ContentResult - Writes content to the response stream without requiring a view
FileContentResult - Returns a file to the client
FileStreamResult - Returns a file to the client, which is provided by a Stream
FilePathResult - Returns a file to the client

Can traverse data in any order front, back.
Returning multiple tables
If, to be serialized
Disconnected architecture
To return from a WCF  service
To send across layers
Caching the data
Do not need to open or close connection

Datareader:
-----------

Web application
Large data
Can traverse only forward.
Returning multiple tables
For Fast data access
Needs explicitly closed
Output parameter value will only available after close
returns only a row after read

Difference between ViewBag & ViewData:
1. ViewData is a dictionary of objects that is derived from ViewDataDictionary class and
accessible using strings as keys.
2. ViewBag is a dynamic property that takes advantage of the new dynamic features in C#
4.0.
3. ViewData requires typecasting for complex data type and check for null values to avoid
error.
4. ViewBag doesn’t require typecasting for complex data type.

Difference between == and === in JavaScript [duplicate]
------------------------------------------------

http://conceptf1.blogspot.in/2014/01/javascript-triple-equals-vs-double-equals-operators.html
http://www.impressivewebs.com/why-use-triple-equals-javascipt/

0 == false   // true
0 === false  // false, because they are of a different type
1 == "1"     // true, automatic type conversion for value only
1 === "1"    // false, because they are of a different type
null == undefined // true
null === undefined // false
'0' == false // true
'0' === false // false



This is because the equality operator == does type coercion, meaning that the interpreter implicitly tries to convert the values before comparing.

On the other hand, the identity operator === does not do type coercion, and thus does not convert the values when comparing.
